        <p style="text-align: center">I visited Madison, Wisconsin to look at a college. I probably won't go there for school because of the price, but I really liked the city. It was very pretty and had vines everywhere. It also had two lakes and a bunch of fun stores, like record shops and resale clothing stores. It was a cool environment.</p>
