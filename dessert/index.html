        <br>
        <p style="text-align: center">I like chocolate cake. It is a good dessert. It is best when it has chocolate chips in it. However, whether it is good or not all depends on the icing. Good chocolate cake has delicious icing and perhaps even some chocolate fudge dripped over the top with ice cream on the side. Restaurants like to serve this dessert.</p>
