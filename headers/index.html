        <h1>Beetles</h1>
        <h2>External Morphology</h2>
        <h3>Head</h3>
        <h4>Beetle antennae can detect motion, odor, and chemicals. They may also use their anntenae to balance or during mating.</h4>
        <h3>Mouthparts</h3>
        <h4>Beetles have mouthparts similar to grasshopppers. They have two mandibles that grasp, crush, or cut food or enemies. Males generally have bigger mandibles.</h4>
        <h3>Thorax</h3>
        <h4>The thorax is segmented into two.</h4>
        <h3>Prothorax and Pterothorax</h3>
        <h4>The pterothorax is flexibly articulate from the prothorax.</h4>
        <h3>Legs</h3>
        <h4>Beetles have multisegmented legs. They also have claws.</h4>
        <h3>Wings</h3>
        <h4>The forewings of beetles protect their hindwings. The hindwings are what allows for beetles to fly.</h4>
        <h3>Abdomen</h3>
        <h4>The abdomen of the beetle is made up of rings that each have a hole for braething. It is composed of three different segments. The sternum is the most visible part of the abdomen.</h4>
