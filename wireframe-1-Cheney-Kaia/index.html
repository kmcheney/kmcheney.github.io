                    <p id="pthree">Hogwarts is from the book series "Harry Potter." There are seven books in the series and they were written by J.K. Rowling. The series mostly takes placea at the school, so Hogwarts is probably the most important setting in the books. It is where the main character and his friends live from September to June and where they attend school.</p>

        <ul style="padding:3% 10%;">
            <li>Within Hogwarts is a "Room of Requirement." It is Unplottable (unable to be mapped by any means) and becomes whatever the user desires it to be.</li>
            <li>Hogwarts is home to both staff, students, various ghosts, mystical creatures, portraits, pets, and a Poltergeist named Peeves.</li>
            <li>Hogwarts has four houses: Hufflepuff (the house of the fair), Gryffindor (the house of the brave), Slytherin (the house of the cunning), and Ravenclaw (the house of the wise). Students are sorted into these houses by a magical hat. Rarely, the hat takes longer than five minutes to decide your house. When this happens it is called a Hatstall. The hat decides your house based off of your personality and potential.</li>
            <li>Hogwarts is home to 142 staircases (many of which like to move around).</li>
            <li>Hogwarts was founded in the 10th century. It has four founders, which its houses are named after. These founders were Helga Huffleuff, Godric Gryffindor, Salazar Slytherin, and Rowena Ravenclaw. </li>
