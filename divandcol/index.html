            <h2>Halloween</h2>
            <p>Halloween is my all-time favorite holiday. I make my costume every year and I love getting to dress up as my favorite characters. Plus, the holiday is guaranteed to be full of chocolate and friends. I love chocolate and my friends. I am looking forward to Halloween this year.</p>
            <hr>
            <h2>Christmas</h2>
            <p>Christmas actually makes me sad and I have no idea why we celebrate it since my family is not Christian. But the presents are fun and I love that I get to see my family. I like to make them happy with the gifts I give them. And my friends and I usually give each other gifts as well.</p>
            <hr>
            <h2>New Year's Eve</h2>
            <p>I usually get to have a sleepover with my friends on New Year's Eve so that's nice. In general it is pretty boring though. And the fireworks give me anxiety so I don't like that part either. Also I don't see the point of celebrating the start of a new year. It isn't a real milestone and it's not like come January first everything changes. It is exactly the same as before but we write a different year down.</p>
            <hr>
            <h2>Valentine's Day</h2>
            <p>There's also generally chocolate on Valentine's Day, so that's awesome. The rest of it is kind of annoying because people at school are weird with whoever they are dating. Generally my friend throws a Galentine's party instead but usually there are a lot of people there that I don't know or care about.</p>
            <hr>
            <h2>Thanksgiving</h2>
            <p>This is the most boring holiday to ever exist and I hate the food. But we get a week off of school so that is great. Also I'm pretty sure there's some controversy with the whole start of it and I'd really love if it just didn't exist. Plus the family I get to see for it tends to include my grandfather and I don't like him so it really isn't worth it.</p>

            <p>(Yeah I generally don't like the basis of most holidays aside from Halloween. And I don't have any weird family traditions that we celebrate. So.)</p>
